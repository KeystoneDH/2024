<h3>Keynotes!</h3>
<p>We are delighted to welcome our distinguished keynote presenters, <strong>Amanda Licastro</strong> and <strong>Micki Kaufman</strong>!
Kaufman and Licastro will lead a new kind of immersive keynote event at this year's conference,
to offer participants an opportunity to explore
digital humanities projects designed and developed in virtual / augmented reality.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kaufman will present her &quot;Quantifying Kissinger&quot; project: a scholarly archive designed for 3D abstract interactive immersion via game engine technology.</li>
<li>Licastro's presentation, &quot;Embracing the Glitch&quot;, will address supporting Extended Reality (XR) across the curriculum, and will feature student work from her course
(Virtual Bodies, Virtual Worlds).</li>
</ul>
<p>Participants will have multiple
options for experiencing / viewing the immersive events. They may opt
to try headsets and immerse themselves with guidance in a virtual constructed space, or they may watch the
virtual world projected on monitors.</p>
<h3>Accessing the conference</h3>
<p>Like last year's successful event, the 2024 conference will be <strong>fully in person</strong>. We ask all participants to join us on site at Penn State Behrend's campus.
(In case of problems / disrupted travel, please be in touch with your
session chair / co-panelists who may be able to facilitate a virtual connection on site.)</p>
<ul>
<li>We plan to provide low-cost accommodations on Behrend campus, in easy walking range of conference events.</li>
<li>Hotels are available near campus or on the waterfront in Erie, but most will require transit or be easier with car transport. We'll provide travel guidance on this site!</li>
<li>Please <a href="mailto:contact@keystonedh.network">write to the organizers</a> with questions about access.</li>
