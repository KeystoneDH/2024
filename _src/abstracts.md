### Black Ludology: Theorizing Play in Black Literature

<i class="name">Austin Anderson - Howard University</i>

Friedrich Schiller famously claimed, “man only plays when in the full meaning of the word he is a man, and he is only completely a man when he plays.” To play is to be human. While the totalizing system of anti-Blackness that developed in tandem and as rational for transatlantic slavery dictated that Black people were not fully human nor fully alive, Black literature has repeatedly refused this logic, and literary representations of play have repeatedly activated aliveness in Black literature. Using the History of Black Writing corpus, I explore the many mentions of “games,” “play,” “sports,” “gambling,” and other terms that are associated with ludic pleasure in Black literature. How have Black writers discussed, explored, and represented play in literary works? What is distinct about these references to play? How can these instances of play help us theorize about Black ludology? By exploring the persistent allusions to “play” and associated terms in Black literature, this project hopes to work towards a theory of Black ludology through Black literature. This presentation begins by charting the many mentions of “play” within the History of Black Writing corpus by applying Distant Reading to the corpus, and then it turns to several exemplary instances of play in Black literature. After offering close readings of these instances of play, I work towards a theory about ludology in Black literature, including its aesthetic value and political power.

Around the world, many cultures are significantly threatened by the erosion of cultural integrity, climate change, loss of habitat, the environmental impact of globalization, and the ravages of epidemics. Cultures that do not have a strong written tradition are especially threatened – as younger generations move away in search of education and jobs, and as globalization forces linguistic shifts to more “global” languages such as English and iish, rich oral traditions either disappear completely or become artifacts in university or library archives, accessible only to small groups of academics.  Many initiatives have been activated to preserve and revitalize indigenous cultures, traditions, and languages. While quite a few of these initiatives involve the use of computational technologies and multimedia to document and archive indigenous languages, knowledge, and cultures, much of what has been created to date is primarily designed to serve academic communities and does not provide access to either the broader public (e.g., anyone who wishes to learn about a particular culture) or to the indigenous communities that provided the data in the first place. Moreover, existing systems tend to focus on a single corpus of stories and do not provide possibilities to connect and map stories, characters, and concepts across multiple cultures and languages.

Our team has collaborated with indigenous communities in Ecuador and with scholars from several universities to develop StoryWorlds ITK (Indigenous Traditional Knowledge), an innovative software infrastructure designed for cultural preservation and education. StoryWorlds ITK consists of two interconnected systems - (1) a web-based knowledge graph (KG) data collection and management system which stores, connects, and presents Indigenous traditional knowledge (ITK) in the form of stories, myths, and testimonies from multiple cultures and languages; (2) a virtual environment rendering pipeline which utilizes large language models (LLM), Unity3D, and Meta Quest software development kit (SDK) to procedurally generate virtual worlds from the KG data.

### Environmental Ethics through a Game of Non-mastery in the novel 'The Overstory.'

<i class="name">Sayan Bhattacharyya</i>

<i class="affil">Yale University</i>

Can caricaturish depictions of pop-culture-tinged, new-age-y, faddish-sounding depictions of environmental ethics from the Global South in a western novel nevertheless serve simultaneously to lead the reader into a deeper and serious understanding of the philosophical tradition involved, in spite of the neo-orientalist tenor of such a depiction? I show how the U.S. novelist Richard Powers pulls off this difficult feat in his novel ‘The Overstory’. [1] I argue that Powers stages a necessary dialog between Indian environmental ethics and western environmentalism based on contemporary science-based environmental ethics. Powers accomplishes this, I show, through his complex portrayal of an Indian-American character who and whose immigrant family, on the surface, press the reader’s buttons in a way that conforms to prevalent, stereotypical views of the Indian immigrant in western society: the model minority dispensing earthy but trite philosophical  wisdom as well as academic nerd inordinately given over to “techie” skills, especially computer programming. Starting from such an apparently unpromising starting premise, in which this character, Nilay Mehta, and his immigrant parents, seem destined to provide unselfconscious comic relief and to be the butt, almost, of an off-color stereotypical  and even borderline-racist joke, Powers nevertheless succeeds, as the novel progresses, to endow the character with a genuine depth and complexity, and to make of him a pivotal element of a compelling, un-preachy and serious narrative plot. The key element that makes this possible is the way that Powers weaves into the story a plot element consisting of an elaborate computer video game that Nilay is depicted, over a number of long years, to have dedicated himself to creating in course of his Silicon Valley work career. This game has evolved into a “game of emergence” from its initial beginnings as a “game of progression” (in Juul’s senses of these terms). [2]  I argue that such an approach in fiction, which meets the western reader where the reader is with respect to his or her initial knowledge of non-western traditions, may in fact be a very useful way to recruit environmental traditions from around the world to fit within a common and legible framework in dialog with science that informs the reader without being condescending — in fact by subverting condescension.

I show that this video game, as depicted in the novel, is crucial in settiung up a parallelism between two fantasies of supersession: ecological time as a “dark” hyperobject [3] transcending and ultimately superseding the human-scale time of phenomenological experience, on the one hand, and a virtual-reality planetary simulacrum populated by AI agents, on the other. Initially termed “Mastery”, the game is narrated to have evolved to constitute, eventually. the simulacrum of an automated posthuman and post-capitalist utopia in which the need for what Marxist geographers would call a “spatial fix” based on mastery has actually been superseded. What initially seemed an elaborate “in”-joke toying with the figure of the archetypal “nerd outsider” turns out to be anything but, as the novel progresses. With the help of recent theoretical interventions made by Bruce Clarke [4], I will present a reading of the novel as providing a narratological connection between the two dimensions of time and of value-extraction, extending beyond the human, into a common framework constituted by entropy — in terms of entropy’s connection with the thermodynamic arrow of time and its relation to energy-transformations.

### Cyber-Play: Interactive Digital Storytelling

<i class="name">Sara Cantwell</i>

<i class="affil">SUNY Potsdam</i>

From a return to oral storytelling with virtual tabletop-assisted (VTT) tabletop roleplaying games (TTRPGs) to video games with node-based coded narratives, we will examine how and why contemporary stories now require differing levels of digital literacy, community building, and player/reader agency. This presentation will outline the various shapes and structures of contemporary digital storytelling that are possible through our current media. It will highlight how interactive storytelling is enhanced via digital assets and how these enhancements are finding their way back into more traditional storytelling media. We’ll discuss the difference between readers and players, why knowing your audience's expectations and level of digital literacy is paramount, and how to make space for audience interactivity and improvisation in stories.

Contemporary digital storytelling tools, owing a large debt to the digital hypertext and narrative footnoting of the 1980s and 1990s, have enabled us to reshape our thinking about how and why stories are told. Digital tools allow storytellers to create recursive stories and metanarratives. Digital tool innovation allows for new ways to deliver content that unites the message to the medium and otherwise creates textual complexity for an audience to manipulate and consume. The capabilities of contemporary digital media are still being actively explored and developed for several multi-billion-dollar mass-market industries. And, thanks in part to the 2020 pandemic, there is a revived interest in communal play through digital storytelling.

This presentation discusses the relationship between narrative, games, and spatial-temporal structure in Julio Cortázar’s generative novel Rayuela (Hopscotch). Famously defiant of traditional reading approaches, this novel offers readers two distinct paths through it and, thus, theorizes two main readerly directions. Building off the premise that games demand a spatialized hermeneutic approach, I interrogate these two readerly paths through the novel by mapping it as two distinct books. Approaching the first book, I discuss the relationship between a traditional hopscotch game, which demands a linear progression across the board. Conversely, in engaging with the second book, I observe the transformation of the hopscotch board into the metaphysical geometrical structure of the mandala. While these two readerly paths offered by Cortázar are distinct spatially and temporally, I argue that they are interrelated structurally. 

To map these two books, I utilize GIS software and Stochastic block models respectively. While the first book invites a traditional chronological readerly approach that follows the novel's protagonist, Horacio Oliveira, on his journey from the streets of Paris before being deported back to Buenos Aires, the second book necessitates exploring a readerly “metaphysics of hopscotching” (Foster, Currents in the Contemporary Argentine Novel, 106) to navigate the text. The latter expects readers to leap between the novel's three sections, the last of which (referred to as "expendable chapters") is entirely excised from the first book. The second, more radical game of hopscotch is, therefore, not a game of hopscotch at all; rather, it mimics the generative mandala, which was the original title of the novel before it became Rayuela (Hopscotch). Thus, while the first book lends itself to a more conventional cartography, the second book is physically non-linear and so produces a different geometrical relationship between spaces, one which requires readers to reconsider space as a network of Brownian motion which can only be coherently visualized by the networked stochastic block model structure. Overall, this paper reflects on how the relationship between narrative and games—including the expanded role of readers and players—is suggestive of a ludic hermeneutic which observes these expanded roles as part of a larger process involving problems of authorship, narrative, game systems, and the active reader/player.

Finding time to ‘do DH’ is a common struggle for myself and the faculty I work with as a Digital Scholarship Librarian. Planning long-term immersive research projects can quickly seem daunting and unwieldy even with the most detailed of project plans. Additionally, as a Digital Scholarship Librarian on a campus with a fairly small and emerging group of DH scholars, the work I mainly support for project design is teaching students in classes and not getting much hands-on experience myself. The day-to-day management of our workshops, consultation schedules, and service requirements quickly leave little room for the hands-on play and exploration of DH tools and methods that drew me to the job.

In an effort to skill-build and stay excited about DH over the course of a semester I assigned myself three mini-projects: a 5 episode podcast, a 10 page digital edition, and a digital exhibit. The goal for each project was to ingrain myself in the project’s workflow as I explored new tools and processes taking my experience in creation back to the classroom or consultations. The projects would also serve as a showcase and portfolio of the types of tools and methods that we could support from the library and could include specific information and support materials about those tools and methods that would not be included in a more general showcase. My presentation will outline my experience sharing tips for intentionally creating time for project creation and skill-building.

### Discovery Research and Digital Archives in Teaching Renaissance Drama

<i class="name">Maria Doyle</i>

<i class="affil">University of West Georgia</i>

Nancy Hensel argues in her introduction to _Course-Based Undergraduate Research: Educational Equity and High-Impact Practice_ (2018) that “Reframing the concept of undergraduate research from the apprentice model to a concept that includes working with a whole class and seeing the acquisition of research skills as a developmental process is needed for course-based research.” This presentation will explore ways that this “whole class” collaborative model can be used to encourage contextual awareness and the process of discovery in a Renaissance drama course for students at a regional state institution, many of whom are taking the course to fulfill a breadth requirement in the English major. For students with little experience with the early modern period, aside from isolated and potentially anxiety-producing encounters with Shakespeare, this project was designed to generate excitement for the period and to move students away from thinking of research exclusively as an exercise in reading other people’s interpretations of literary works. The project engaged students in targeted but open-ended explorations of a collection of digital archives, including University of Toronto’s _Records of Early English Drama_ and University of Victoria’s interactive _Map of Early Modern London_, as a means of developing students’ awareness of the material culture and local controversies that served as background to the plays included on the syllabus. This presentation will focus on the project’s multi-stage design and the elements of choice and play that informed it. Although students interacted with the archives individually and submitted individual progress checks to encourage deep and sustained engagement with the material, the final product was not a formal paper – a closed-ended task -- but a group information-sharing session, itself an extension of their original process of discovery. The open-ended nature of this product resulted in students who were less intimidated by the need to produce a polished and definitive response on material they had little experience with; they were thus more willing to formulate questions and compare ideas. Combined with more traditional writing and analysis activities, this project, which draws on a growing body of digital period-specific materials, provides students with a more robust engagement with the literature of the period and an understanding of research as a process of ongoing exploration.

### Professionalization and Play: Digital Portfolio Design on Substack

<i class="name">Maureen Gallagher</i>

<i class="affil">University of Pittsburgh</i>

As an instructor of Public and Professional Writing at the University of Pittsburgh, I find that undergraduate students highly value the development of digital deliverables that they can use as writing samples for internship applications and other professional opportunities. At the same time, undergraduate students are more highly motivated, and take increased of ownership of their writing and design efforts, when they have opportunities to play and explore, especially with contemporary digital tools that integrate multimodal design.

For the capstone project in Writing for the Public, an advanced composition course, I assign a digital portfolio on the Substack Newsletter platform. This digital portfolio connects student interests in both playful self-expression and professional development. I draw on the theory of Connected Learning, a pedagogical approach that builds on constructionism and extends the constructionist approach to the digital age. Connected Learning focuses on the affordances of digital technology to provide "engaging formats for interactivity and self-expression” (Ito, 2013, p. 6). Connected Learning is a socially embedded, interest-driven approach that “centers on an equity agenda” to channel new media-based learning opportunities in ways that translate into academic achievement for more students, including students from non-dominant groups (Ito, 2013, pp. 7-8).

I argue that Connected Learning theory applies to digital portfolio development on the Substack platform because this assignment sequence fulfills key criteria for learning through play. Substack:
o         is customizable
o         fosters creativity
o         encourages self-expression / personal writing
o         is public-facing and therefore foregrounds the relationship between writer and readers
o         integrates multimodal composition (visual / design elements, photos, hyperlinks)
o         provides a learning context that bridges in-school and out-of-school learning and experiences
