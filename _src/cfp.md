### Theme
This year's conference theme is **play**: the fun of exploring, gaming,
trying new things without being sure you understand them.
Our theme of “play” celebrates experimentation and immersion in the experience of digital humanities.
While we welcome proposals that address our conference theme, 
presentations need not address the theme directly, and may address any aspect of digital humanities broadly conceived. 

### Details
We are planning 90-minute panel blocks (as usual for this conference). You may submit proposals for individual ~15-minute presentations or 
for fully a formed "roundtable" panel with multiple identified participants. 

As with previous Keystone DH conferences, we welcome a range of proposals, including:
* Presentations to share digital and public humanities projects;
* Presentations on DH pedagogy / research exploring, critiquing, applying, developing generative AI;
* Progress / methods in developing digital scholarly editions 
* Roundtable discussions on new directions and potential energies in humanities work digitally practiced;
* Workshops to share/get advice on projects in progress, which this year may take the form of
  * short immersive installations of 3D projects
  * interface work for browser exploration of digital scholarship
  * investigations of a method (e.g. data sonification, analyzing/curating/classifying visual arts, natural language processing, network analysis, mapping time and space).

### Use of generative AI language tools:
Since generative AI is an important and timely area of investigation in digital humanities, we 
are interested in your experiments with it, but we expect our conference participants to take responsibility for authorship of proposals and presentations. 
We ask that conference applicants and presenters report their use of generative AI language tools, following
[arXiv's AI policy](https://blog.arxiv.org/2023/01/31/arxiv-announces-new-policy-on-chatgpt-and-similar-tools/).
