### Theme
The theme of Keystone DH 2024 is **play**, the serious fun of exploration, experimentation, immersion in digital humanities. While we welcome proposals that address our conference theme, presentations need not address the theme directly, and may address any aspect of digital humanities broadly conceived. 

### Details
We are planning 90-minute panel blocks (as usual for this conference). You may submit proposals for individual ~15-minute presentations or 
for fully a formed "roundtable" panel with multiple identified participants. 

As with previous Keystone DH conferences, we welcome a range of proposals, including:
* Presentations to share digital and public humanities projects;
* Presentations on digital humanities pedagogy
* Work on exploring, critiquing, applying, developing generative AI;
* Methods / progress in developing digital scholarly editions and archives;
* Curation efforts with digital ephemera;
* Games, game-making, game-playing in humanities work;
* Roundtable discussions on new directions and potential energies in humanities work digitally practiced;
* “Workshopping” to share/get advice on projects in progress, which could take the form of:
  * short immersive installations of 3D projects,
  * interface design and development in progress,
  * investigations of a method (e.g. data sonification, analyzing/curating/classifying visual arts, natural language processing, network analysis, mapping time and space),
  * something we haven't thought of here!

### Use of generative AI language tools:
Since generative AI is an important and timely area of investigation in digital humanities, we 
are interested in your experiments with it, but we expect our conference participants to take responsibility for authorship of proposals and presentations. 
We ask that conference applicants and presenters report their use of generative AI language tools, following
[arXiv's AI policy](https://blog.arxiv.org/2023/01/31/arxiv-announces-new-policy-on-chatgpt-and-similar-tools/).

### Submission Form and Timeline
* Please send your submissions through **[our Proposal Submission Form](https://forms.gle/pNKMjbZVr6Hz4qwV9)** by Monday **March 1**. 
* We plan to respond to all submissions by March 15.
* Conference dates: Monday - Wednesday May 20 - 22, 2024.
