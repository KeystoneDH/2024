This year's conference theme is **play**: the fun of exploring, gaming,
trying new things without being sure you understand them.
Our theme of "play" celebrates experimentation and immersion in the experience of digital humanities.
While we welcome proposals that address our conference theme, 
presentations need not address the theme directly, but may address any aspect of digital humanities broadly conceived. 

As with previous Keystone DH conferences, we welcome a range of proposals, including:
* Papers (slide) presentations to share scholarship, research, projects
* Roundtable discussions
* Workshops to share/get advice on projects in progress, which this year may take the form of
  * short immersive installations of 3D projects 
  * any kind of digital/mobile interactive project development 

We ask for submissions by **March 1**, and will respond by March 15. 
The submission form will be posted here soon!
