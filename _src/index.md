This year, the Keystone DH conference will be hosted by the [DIGIT](https://digit-psb.github.io/DIGIT/) program
at [Penn State Erie, The Behrend College](https://behrend.psu.edu/) on  <strong>May 20 - 22, 2024</strong>.

This year's conference theme is <strong>play</strong>: the fun of exploring, gaming, 
trying new things without being sure you understand them. 
Our theme of "play" celebrates experimentation and immersion in the experience of digital humanities. 
Presentations need not address this theme directly, but the conference organizers invite 
opportunities to play with the newly developing Retro Game and Virtual Augmented Reality labs at Penn State Behrend.

We are delighted to welcome our distinguished keynote presenters, **Amanda Licastro** and **Micki Kaufman**! 
Kaufman and Licastro will lead a new kind of immersive keynote event at this year's conference,
to offer participants an opportunity to explore 
digital humanities projects designed and developed in virtual / augmented reality. 
* Kaufman will present her "Quantifying Kissinger" project: a scholarly archive designed for 3D abstract interactive immersion via game engine technology.
* Licastro's presentation, titled "Embracing the Glitch", will address supporting Extended Reality (XR) across the curriculum, and will feature work from her course
Virtual Bodies, Virtual Worlds) highlighting student projects. 


Participants will have multiple 
options for experiencing / viewing the immersive events. They may opt 
to try headsets and immerse themselves with guidance in a virtual constructed space, or they may watch the
virtual world projected on monitors. 

Please watch this space for details on paper / project submissions, workshops, and conference details!
