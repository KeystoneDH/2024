The 2024 Keystone DH conference will be hosted by the [DIGIT](https://digit-psb.github.io/DIGIT/) program
at [Penn State Erie, The Behrend College](https://behrend.psu.edu/) on  <strong>May 20 - 22, 2024</strong>.

Our theme is <strong>play</strong>: the fun of exploring, gaming, trying new things without being sure you understand them.
Our theme of “play” celebrates experimentation and immersion in the experience of digital humanities. 
Presentations need not address this theme directly, but the conference organizers invite 
opportunities to play with newly developing Retro Game and Virtual Augmented Reality labs at Penn State Behrend. 

Students, early-career and non-traditional scholars, faculty researchers, digital scholarship librarians,
designers, developers, explorers experimenting with “digital humanities” are all welcome to apply at our [Call for Papers](cfp.html). 

### Keynotes!
We are delighted to welcome our distinguished keynote presenters, **Amanda Licastro** and **Micki Kaufman**! 
Kaufman and Licastro will lead a new kind of immersive keynote event at this year's conference,
to offer participants an opportunity to explore 
digital humanities projects designed and developed in virtual / augmented reality. 
* Kaufman will present her "Quantifying Kissinger" project: a scholarly archive designed for 3D abstract interactive immersion via game engine technology.
* Licastro's presentation, "Embracing the Glitch", will address supporting Extended Reality (XR) across the curriculum, and will feature student work from her course
  (Virtual Bodies, Virtual Worlds).

Participants will have multiple 
options for experiencing / viewing the immersive events. They may opt 
to try headsets and immerse themselves with guidance in a virtual constructed space, or they may watch the
virtual world projected on monitors.

### Accessing the conference

Like last year's successful event, the 2024 conference will be **fully in person**. We ask all participants to join us on site at Penn State Behrend's campus.
(In case of problems / disrupted travel, please be in touch with your
session chair / co-panelists who may be able to facilitate a virtual connection on site.)
* We plan to provide low-cost accommodations on Behrend campus, in easy walking range of conference events.
* Hotels are available near campus or on the waterfront in Erie, but most will require transit or be easier with car transport. We'll provide travel guidance on this site!
* Please [write to the organizers](mailto:contact@keystonedh.network) with questions about access.
