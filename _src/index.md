### Keynotes!

We are delighted to welcome our distinguished keynote presenters, **Micki Kaufman**, **Amanda Licastro**, and **Jasmine Clark**! 
Kaufman, Licastro, and Clark will each lead a new immersive style of keynote event,
to offer participants an opportunity to explore 
digital humanities projects designed and developed in virtual / augmented reality.

* Kaufman will present her <q>Quantifying Kissinger</q> project: a scholarly archive designed for 3D abstract interactive immersion via game engine technology.
* Licastro's presentation, "Embracing the Glitch", will address supporting Extended Reality (XR) across the curriculum, and will feature student work from her course
  (Virtual Bodies, Virtual Worlds).
* Clark will share the <q>Virtual Bloxson</q>, an educational game to orient students to Black primary source materials. 

Participants will have multiple 
options for experiencing / viewing the immersive events. They may opt 
to try headsets and immerse themselves with guidance in a virtual constructed space, or they may watch the
virtual world projected on monitors.



### Accessing the conference

Like last year's successful event, the 2024 conference will be **fully in person**. We ask all participants to join us on site at Penn State Behrend's campus.
(In case of problems / disrupted travel, please be in touch with your
session chair / co-panelists who may be able to facilitate a virtual connection on site.)
* We plan to provide low-cost accommodations on Behrend campus, in easy walking range of conference events.
* Hotels are available near campus or on the waterfront in Erie, but most will require transit or be easier with car transport. We'll provide travel guidance on this site!
* Please [write to the organizers](mailto:contact@keystonedh.network) with questions about access.
