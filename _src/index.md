## 
Keystone DH is a network of institutions and practitioners committed to advancing collaborative scholarship in digital humanities research and pedagogy across the Mid-Atlantic. This year, the Keystone DH conference will be hosted by [DIGIT](https://digit-psb.github.io/DIGIT/)'s DH Lab
at [Penn State Erie, The Behrend College](https://behrend.psu.edu/) on  <strong>May 20 - 22, 2024</strong>.

This year's conference theme is play: the fun of exploring, designing, gaming and game-making, trying new things without being sure you understand them, or giving serious purposes and scholarly research a playful twist..        
        
Watch this space for the Call for Papers, planned workshops, invited speakers, and special events!
