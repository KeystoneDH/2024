Keystone DH is a network of institutions and practitioners committed 
to advancing collaborative scholarship in digital humanities research and pedagogy 
across the Mid-Atlantic. We invite schools and constituents within schools
to participate across traditional “peer institution” or categorical divide, as well as across faculty,
staff, and students (undergraduate and graduate) as well as independent scholars. 
Each year, Keystone DH aims to host a conference at one of the 
participating institutions in the region.
