## Who is Keystone DH?

Keystone DH is a network of institutions and practitioners committed 
to advancing collaborative scholarship in digital humanities research and pedagogy 
across the Mid-Atlantic. We invite schools and constituents within schools
to participate across traditional “peer institution” or categorical divides, as well as faculty,
staff, and students (undergraduate and graduate) and independent scholars. 
Each year, Keystone DH aims to host a conference at one of the 
participating institutions in the region.

We are grateful for generous support from the Penn State University Humanities Institute and the School of Humanities & Social Sciences at Penn State Erie, The Behrend College to host this conference.

<h2 id="cod"> Code of Conduct</h2>

We work to make the Keystone DH Conference to be a welcoming, supportive, and comfortable environment for all participants. We are a diverse community of professionals representing different age groups, genders, physical and mental abilities, cultures, ethnicities, educational levels, languages, national origins, political beliefs, professions, races, religions, sexual orientations, socioeconomic statuses, sizes, and technical abilities. We will not understand things the same way, and in that diversity is the strength of our conference community.  

We encourage the following supportive behaviors:

- Be friendly and welcoming: honor pronoun preferences and use gender-neutral collective nouns (e.g. <quote>chairperson</quote>).
- Consider your diverse audience: Colloquialisms, specific cultural references, and humor may prevent someone else from understanding the conveyed message.
- Accept critique graciously and offer it kindly and constructively. 
- Encourage and yield the floor to those whose viewpoints may be under-represented in a group.
- Negotiate differences respectfully: We expect disagreements of many kinds (philosophical, technical, etc) at a conference. The fruits of these disagreements could yield new ways of seeing and thinking. The strength of our community comes from its diversity. Help each other to resolve issues, find common ground, and learn from mistakes.
- Be ethical: Give credit where it is due. Be sure to properly acknowledge and credit contributions of others to your work. 

We will not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to race, ethnicity, sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, country of origin, age, disability, physical appearance, body size, religion, veteran status or other protected class status; discriminatory or offensive images in public spaces; intimidation; stalking; harassing or unwanted photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants violating the code of conduct may be warned or asked to leave by conference organizers.

### Recording/Social Media Policy

We see the conference as a place to share information, not only with other participants, but also with those who may not be able to attend. Sessions are, by default, considered open and can be written about on social media and photographed. Each session's panelists can decide to adopt different rules at the beginning of the session as long as it informs all participants who join the session.

Keystone DH 2024 is an in-peron conference, with a few presenters joining virtually for select panels. We are using Zoom as a platform for the hybrid aspects of Keystone DH 2024. Zoom’s privacy and security statements and information about removing your data from each of them are available on their website. <a href="https://explore.zoom.us/en/privacy/" target="_blank">Visit Zoom’s Privacy Statement</a> for more information. Because Keystone DH 2024 is primarily an in-person conference experience, _we are not intending to record presentations_. The conversations we have here are defined by the people coming together in the timeframe of the conference only. What we choose to share (on social media and on the conference website) after the event will be the deliberate choice of the conference presenters.

To contact the conference organizers about any concern, please email [contact at keystonedh dot network](mailto:contact@keystonedh.network). During the conference, our Slack channel shared with all registrants is a convenient way to reach the organizers quickly.

We have updated and gently adapted this code of conduct from that of [Keystone DH 2023](https://keystonedh.network/2023/code), [the TEI community](https://tei-c.org/about/code-of-conduct/), and [Balisage: the Markup Conference](https://www.balisage.net/conduct.html).
