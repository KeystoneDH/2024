### How to Travel to Penn State Erie

[The campus website](https://behrend.psu.edu/admission/visit-penn-state-behrend/directions-to-campus) recommends number of transit options, leading you to our little airport in Erie, that's only served by American Airlines.

In our experience, Charlotte NC is the one American hub that sends people to Erie. Expect a flight to go, say, Philly to Charlotte to Erie.

Looking for something more direct? You can also fly into Buffalo, Cleveland, or Pittsburgh international airports.

* Buffalo is the closest (about 90-minutes drive away).
* Cleveland is about 2 hours away, and Pittsburgh is like 2.5 hours by car.
* Caution: There are not great transit options or shuttle from any of these, so if you want to plan one of these flights, be in touch with us conference organizers (by e-mail st [contact at keystonedh dot network](mailto:contact@keystonedh.network)) and we can try to arrange a carpool or rideshare with other attendees.
* The campus directions also recommend car rental, though we do have some limited transit options.
